LibUsbDotNet Benchmark Console Application

USAGE: benchmark [pid=] [list] [read|write|loop] [vid=] [retry=] 
                 [timeout=] [size=] [refresh=]
Commands:
         list  : Display a list of connected devices before starting. 
                 Select the device to use for the test from the list.
         read  : Read from the device.
         write : Write to the device.
         loop  : [Default] Read and write to the device at the same time.
Switches:
         pid     : Product id of device. (hex)
         vid     : Vendor id of device. (hex) (Default=0x04D8)
         retry   : Number of times to retry a transfer that timesout
         timeout : Transfer timeout value. (in milliseconds) (Default=1)
                   The timeout value used for read/write operations. If a
                   transfer times out more than {retry} times, the test 
                   fails and the operation is aborted.
         size    : Transfer test size in bytes. (Default=4096)
                   Increasing this value will generally yield higher
                   transfer rates. Using a value greater than 65536 is not
                   recommended. 
         priority: AboveNormal|BelowNormal|Highest|Lowest|Normal
                   (Default=AboveNormal) The thread priority level to use
                   for the test.
         refresh : The display refresh interval. (in milliseconds)
                   (Default=1000) This also effect the running status.
         driver  : libusb10|winusb (Default=winusb)
                   LibUsbDotNet supports three different drivers on windows.
                   winusb, libusb-win32, and libusb-1.0.  If winusb is set 
                   and the device is a libusb-win32 device, the libusb-win32
                   driver will be used instead. On unix-like platforms this
                   switch has no effect.
         
WARNING:
          This example only works with custom usb hardware. Using this
          example on a usb device it was not designed for could be
          catastrophic! To meet the requirements, your usb hardware
          must implement loopback functionality in Config 1,
          Interface 0, Endpoints 0x01 and 0x81.
          
Examples:

benchmark pid=0001
benchmark pid=0001 read
benchmark pid=0001 write
benchmark pid=0001 size=65536
