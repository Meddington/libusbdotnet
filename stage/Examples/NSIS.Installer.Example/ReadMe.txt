This is an example of how to create an NSIS application installer
that installs your appcation, .NET 2.0 framework and pre-installs
your WinUsb or LibUsb device driver.  

NOTE:
None of the actual application/driver files have been included, 
therefor this example will not compile without first tailoring
the "CidBox.Net.nsi" file for you application.
